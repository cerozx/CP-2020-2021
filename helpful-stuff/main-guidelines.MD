# Primary Guidelines For Our Team

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***1. This rule should be basic, DO NOT EVER go to other team's competing areas at all. WE can be accused of cheating for this and can end up as DISQUALIFICATION***

***2. Do not use scripts that are found online or distribute our scripts to other teams, if a team is wondering how we did so well or wants to know how to script simply say "Bob Ross"***

***3. After a competition, you CANNOT talk about it with ANYONE until the scores are posted from that competition. It's obvious you aren't allowed to do it during competition either.***

***4. NEVER EVER open random .JAR FILES or open random .BASH FILES, or any sort of file that can run commands. This will screw this over and if you break this rule it is called "PULLING A THOMAS".***

***5. DO NOT add a password to the main user, if you DO make sure you write it down first CASE SENSITIVE and be SURE of it or this can screw us over completely. If you break this rule it is called "PULLING A MICHAEL".***

***6. If you are assigned to a certain image stay on it, if someone is up eating or using the bathroom, DO NOT take their seat if they're working on an image. If you are just sitting there until they're back ABSOLUTELY DO NOT TOUCH THE MOUSE, KEYBOARD, TOUCHPAD, or the computer in general. In this competition, there are things that if are even messed with a little it can screw us over entirely. If you break this rule it is called "PULLING A SUYASH".***

***7. During competitions, if you sit there and do nothing at all and not even help a little. We will talk to you, but if you sit there and MESS things up. You will be kicked off the team pretty quickly. This year is the year to go to nationals or NASHIES this is one of our only chances.***

***8. Lastly, make sure you pitch in within the snack game. Hayden will usually order pizza. I will bring the chips. Then we need to sort everything else out. If you literally can't bring anything for a financial reason lemme know ASAP.***
